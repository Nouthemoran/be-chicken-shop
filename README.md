# What is a RESTful-API?
A RESTful-API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing web services that promotes interoperability, scalability, simplicity, flexibility, and security.

It enables different software systems to communicate and interact with each other using standard HTTP methods and data formats, facilitating the development of efficient, scalable, and maintainable applications.

# Standard methods
Standard methods in RESTful APIs include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH. These methods are used for retrieving, creating, updating, deleting, and partially modifying resources, respectively.

# Example
For example:

- a GET request retrieves data from a resource, while 
- a POST request creates a new resource. PUT updates an existing resource
- DELETE removes a resource 
- PATCH partially modifies a resource. These methods follow the HTTP protocol and are essential for interacting with RESTful APIs efficiently and consistently.
